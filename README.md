# Dr. N. Sane 🎯


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Technocrats

### Team Members
- Team Lead: Rayhana S          - NSS College of Engineering Palakkad
- Member 2 : Abhishek Arunkumar - NSS College of Engineering Palakkad
- Member 3 : Anoop P            - NSS College of Engineering Palakkad

### Project Description
Dr. N. Sane is a simulation of an AI powered therapist chatbot. The only twist being, it gives sarcastic remarks instead of profound advice. Maybe a bit of real-world sarcasm is what the people needs...  But in the end, who really cares??

*Disclosure: Even though we did most of the work, credit is due for chatgpt for generating a portion of the dataset to be given as replies and giving bits of code when we desperately needed it.*

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Maybe you have felt depressed, like you can't do anything with your life. Maybe you are the kind of person who is easy-going and nothing bothers you much. Well, it doesn't matter what kind of person you are, you may need to feel a bit more low. We will be tackling this 'problem' for the welfare of the people (Thank us later).

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
The solution for such a grand issue is much simpler than you realize. We are simulating an AI therapist chatbot,an insane Dr N.Sane that gives snarky and sarcastic comments to your emotional queries. If chatting with the bot seems like talking with that one friend... You may need to re-evaluate your choices in friendship. Have fun... or don't (It's entirely upto you).
